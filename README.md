# DOH Service Testing Tool

This project is designed to test the functionality of self-hosted DNS-over-HTTPS (DOH) services. It helps verify whether a DOH setup, such as an Nginx reverse proxy for a DOH server like CoreDNS, is correctly configured and operational. It also checks SSL certificate setups and ensures proper communication between the client and the DOH server.

### Purpose

- **Test DOH Services**: Verify that your self-hosted DOH service is functional and compliant.
- **SSL Validation**: Ensure that SSL certificates for the DOH server are correctly configured.

### Example Use Cases

- Testing a DOH service deployed with **Nginx** as a reverse proxy.
- Validating a CoreDNS DOH server with a custom domain and SSL certificate.
